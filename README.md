# Sentiment analysis
Sentiment Analysis task by fine tuning text transformers (ALBERT, XLNET, ELECTRA) on 3 datasets and using wandb agent for hyperparameter sweeps, visualisations.

# How to download datasets?
a) IMDB Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format
b)
c)

# Huggingface models used:
a) Albert : https://huggingface.co/albert-base-v2 
b) Electra: https://huggingface.co/xlnet-base-cased
c) Xlnet: https://huggingface.co/google/electra-base-discriminator

To run the code, Install requirements after creating a virtual environment. Create an account on WandB (https://wandb.ai/), create projects so you can track your hyperparameter sweeps, visualisations there. Before running code, change path to downloaded datasets, saved checkpoint models.
